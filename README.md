# MTG-MatchUps

### Problem Statement

There may be some sites that give you guides but some are more offer more information that others at a cost. Some sites may offer guides but they aren't as helpful if you want to learn how to play a new deck along with tips and tricks for certain match ups.
This site aims to bring helpful guides against decks that you'll most likely be matched up with at tournaments for FREE!

We want to keep players up-to-date with the Modern format that may change after each rotation.
